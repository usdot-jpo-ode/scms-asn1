SCMS Secure Data Permission model
==============================================================================

The described model is based on the new permission model introduced in the latest IEEE 1609.2 draft.
This permission model uses the following parameters
	- PSID (Provider Service ID), which is an application permission
	- SSP (Service Specific Permission), more granular permissions defined by PSID
	  (within the PSID application) 


1. PSID values relevant to the SCMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following list fully covers the PSID values
	- PSID = 35 (0x23), specifies Security Management application
		- Note: All SCMS messages between components will have this PSID
	- PSID = 36 (0x24), specifies CRL application
		- Note: The value requested from IEEE will be in the form of 1-byte value
				(just a placeholder until approved!)
	- PSID = 37 (0x25), specifies Misbehavior Reporting application
		- Note: The value requested from IEEE will be in the form of 1-byte value
				(just a placeholder until approved!)
	- PSID = 310 (0x136), specifies P2P distribution of Security Management information,
		such as CA certificates or CRLs
		- Note: The value requested from IEEE will be in the form of 2-byte value
				(just a placeholder until approved!)


2. PSID/SSP information relevant to the SCMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules for using PSIDs and SSPs within the SCMS scope:
	
	- Certificate should have both PSIDs and SSPs to identify
		- what application area the certificate can be used in
		- what the certificate "can do" (e.g. issue a certificate, sign a BSM, etc)

	- All the secure messages should only have PSIDs (without SSPs, 
	  since the message itself belongs to a specific SSP without explicitely
	  stating SSP in the message)


3. Older PSID/SSP information relevant to the SCMS (as a reminder)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Certs with an EnrollmentScope are implicitly allowed to sign messages with 
-- PSID = 0x23 and and NOT allowed to sign messages with other PSIDs.

-- Certs with a CaScope are implicitly allowed to sign messages with 
-- PSID = 0x23.


4. Valid PSID/SSP combinations that must be covered in the PoC use cases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Certificates in the SCMS

4.1.1 OBE V2V Enrolment Certificate
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.1.2 OBE V2I Enrolment Certificate
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.1.3 OBE V2V Pseudonym Certificate
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.1.4 OBE V2I Identification Certificate
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.1.5 RSE Enrolment Certificate
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.1.6 RSE Identification Certificate
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.1.7 SCMS Component Certificate (internal SCMS Certificate Management)
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?


4.2 Certificate requests to the SCMS

4.2.1 OBE V2V Enrolment Certificate requset
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.2.2 OBE V2I Enrolment Certificate request
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.2.3 OBE V2V Pseudonym Certificate request
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.2.4 OBE V2I Identification Certificate request
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.2.5 RSE Enrolment Certificate request
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.2.6 RSE Identification Certificate request
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.2.7 SCMS Component Certificate request (internal SCMS Certificate Management)
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?


4.3 Internal secure messages in the SCMS

4.3.1 Messages between RA and PCA
4.3.2 Messages between RA and LA
4.3.3 Messages between LA and PCA
......(all others)
	Note: Probably all of them will have the same PSID/SSP combinations
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ? (unique per interface? we do have a unique message identifier pre message already)


4.4 OBE peer-to-peer messages

4.4.1 BSM Messages
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.4.2 Security Management Messages (CA and CRL via P2P)
		PSID = 310 (0x136)
		SSP  = ?


4.5 CRL

4.5.1 V2V CRL
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?

4.5.2 V2I CRL
		PSID = ?
		SSP  = ?
